The aspnet core 2.1 C# code worked unchanged from 2.0.. But Chrome, Edge and IE 11 always showed an illegal CA certificate.<br>I could see, that the public key and the serial no in the certificate received by the browser was different from key and serial no produced by openssl. Only Firefox received the right key.<br>In the end I found out, that the AVG Online Shield had manipulated part of the certificate and made it useless that way. After switching off the SSL trafic scan in AVG everything worked as it should. So keep your AV-Software in mind, when it is not working.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more"

I had Windows Authentication fully configured and working with AD groups and Authentication Scheme policies.  As soon as I added SSL to the mix, I get 3 login prompts and then nothing.  If I enable Anonymous, it works fine with SSL so that part seems to be doing the job.  I just seem to be missing some connection on getting SSL AND Windows Authentication working nicely with each other.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

I've made my own self signed certificate using the powershell command you wrote here. However, my sample web app seems to use its own localhost certificate with a different thumbprint and an expiry of 5 years from now. I've copied the pfx file to my project root with copy to output = true and created certificate.json file to point to the file name / password, and my program.cs looks like this:</p><p>var config = new ConfigurationBuilder()<br>    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())<br>    .AddEnvironmentVariables()<br>    .AddJsonFile("certificate.json", optional: false, reloadOnChange: true)<br>    .AddJsonFile($"certificate.{Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT")}.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)<br>    .Build();</p><p>var certificateSettings = config.GetSection("certificateSettings");<br>string certificateFileName = certificateSettings.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("filename");<br>string certificatePassword = certificateSettings.GetValue&lt;string&gt;("password");</p><p>var certificate = new X509Certificate2(certificateFileName, certificatePassword);</p><p>var host = new WebHostBuilder()<br>    .UseKestrel(<br>        options =&gt;<br>        {<br>            options.AddServerHeader = false;<br>            options.Listen(IPAddress.Loopback, 44321, listenOptions =&gt;<br>            {<br>                listenOptions.UseHttps(certificate);<br>            });<br>        }<br>    )<br>    .UseConfiguration(config)<br>    .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())<br>    .UseStartup&lt;startup&gt;()<br>    .UseUrls("https://localhost:44321")<br>    .Build();</p><p>host.Run();</p><p>--</p><p>I've started with the sample web app from Web Application (MVC) scaffolding with individual user authentication.

Why? In 'Configuring HTTPS in ASP.NET Core 2.0'-section the [program.cs] code block contains line: '.UseUrls("https://localhost:44312")'. However, in the following [startup.cs] code block, a different port number '44321' is loaded into the .SslPort-property. I guess: you have been mixing two examples, because  two screenshots are shown: 1) a chrome browser screenshot from which clearly the URL 'https://localhost:44321' could be read (The legend stated 'Chrome in Ubuntu Linux with Trusted Self-Signed Certificate', whereas the second screenshot stated 'Chrome in Window 10 with Trusted Self-Signed Certificate' from which the URL 'https://localhost:44312'.

keep the certificate password out of source control, simply do the following :<br>1) Create a certificate.json as per example in tutorial, but leave the password blank<br>2) Create a certificate.development.json and store your password in this file<br>3) Chain the certificate.development.json up in your program.cs as per the example in this tutorial<br>4) Add a .gitignore rule to
